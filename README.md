This is my minimal bot named Houdini for Discord. It does everything I need it to do.

First, make a virtual environment for the discord.py module.
Here’s some documentation on how to do so:
https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/

Then install the discord.py module with pip
and run the main.py file!

If you want to contribute code, I’ll add it! As long as it’s not malicious, of course.
